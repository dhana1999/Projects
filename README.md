ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
Analyzing inbound calling team data of a company, to extract useful insights that can help in providing recommendations for manpower planning to reduce call abandonment rate and improve customer experience.
We are given with 23 days call dataset which includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time, the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).
The goal of the project is to attract, engage, and delight customers, turning them into loyal advocates for the business.
